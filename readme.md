This year's theme is Black Cat. As I wasn't able to finish my game last year, I'm probably going to take it fairly easy. Add into it that I'm also just finishing up with a move, the beginning of the school year, and a variety of other things going on, I don't think I'm going to be quite as ambitious as I have been in the past. I'm going to focus on a couple of basic mechanics, and lean heavily into some arcade style stuff with proc-gen to the rescue.

I'll likely piece together some of the build tooling around the game based on the last two years entries, and then I'm going to just focus on getting to a minimalist playable game as quickly as possible, then start polishing this tur... thing as I go.

### Day 10: 2025-08-23T11:00:00.000Z

Well... I finally got around to actually starting some code. Just the a shell for working with.

I do have some ideas for the game. Now to try and get them represented as some code. However, just getting the shell up and going is all I'm worried about for the moment, so this is good enough for an initial commit.
